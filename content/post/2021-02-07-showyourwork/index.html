subtitle: 'Show your work, and become part of a community. The work you show connects you to your niche. Try to share something every day, no matter how small. We all have a growing collection of things we are interested in, so share them with the world. Tell clear stories that entice readers emotionally and teach what you know. Share, but do not overshare. Be ready for trolls, focus on the positives and criticisms instead. Once you can, monetize. The best thing you can do, is never stop. To stop is akin to death in my eyes. Slowing down is a different beast though.'

<div id="you-dont-have-to-be-a-genius." class="section level3">
<h3>1. You don’t have to be a genius.</h3>
<p>We’re all at different points in life. One man’s goal is another man’s past. <a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a> claims that striving for scenius is better than genius. Scenius can be thought of as a collective intelligence. The group can do anything, while the lone genius is limited. You don’t have to be a genius. Instead, you can find a community interested in your interests, by simply showing your work in that field.</p>
</div>
<div id="think-process-not-product." class="section level3">
<h3>2. Think process, not product.</h3>
<p>We like to think people only care about the end product. <a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a> has this belief that no, people care about the process. Though I think the process is important, its only important to a select few. My elders may not care for how asynchronous and segmented programming functions make it so that all the lights in the house turn off at 8pm. They definitely like the end product of not having to turn them all off themselves though.</p>
<p>I think what <a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a> is truly getting at here is the power of a niche. Showing your work is interesting to those within your niche. Framing your work makes it interesting for a general audience.</p>
</div>
<div id="share-something-small-every-day." class="section level3">
<h3>3. Share something small every day.</h3>
<p>This one is self explanatory. Whether a blog post, video, tweet, whatever. Share something small everyday, and one day it can become something huge, like this book!</p>
</div>
<div id="open-up-your-cabinet-of-curiosities." class="section level3">
<h3>4. Open up your cabinet of curiosities.</h3>
<p>We are all collectors. Whether knowledge, entertainment or ticked boxes on a to-do list. The purpose of this point is to share what we do rather than horde it. It can be knowledge, it can be opinions, but I swear if I see another #lunch pic on instagra-</p>
</div>
<div id="tell-good-stories." class="section level3">
<h3>5. Tell good stories.</h3>
<p><a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a> made an interesting note about art galleries and forgeries. A forgery isn’t a bad thing if we judge art by technique alone. But there’s a story to art. Pain, happiness, whatever. We don’t assign value to the act itself, but the emotions put into it. Start with why, in other words.</p>
<p>I don’t believe this is always true. For example when i do a tutorial, I really don’t want to hear the reader’s life story. in that sense, the only thing that matters is being clear. Therefore, I believe the core no matter what medium is being clear, unless we’re in philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div id="teach-what-you-know." class="section level3">
<h3>6. Teach what you know.</h3>
<p>Self explanatory. Teach what you know. One man’s goal is another man’s past. Share what you wish someone shared with you. Share what someone else did share with you! (but make sure to credit them)</p>
</div>
<div id="dont-turn-into-human-spam." class="section level3">
<h3>7. Don’t turn into human spam.</h3>
<p>Don’t be the “Here’s how I made $10000 a month following this one simple trick” guy. Unless you’re an actual guru, don’t say you’re a guru. Never say you’re aspiring, you are or are not.</p>
</div>
<div id="learn-to-take-a-punch." class="section level3">
<h3>8. Learn to take a punch.</h3>
<p>Putting yourself out there means people will have opinions. That’s the beauty of this world. let their opinions exist. Constructive criticism is welcome, but begone trolls.</p>
</div>
<div id="sell-out." class="section level3">
<h3>9. Sell out.</h3>
<p>I don’t quite understand the issue with this point. If you have something to sell, then sell it. List all the “sell out” comments in the troll archive.</p>
</div>
<div id="stick-around." class="section level3">
<h3>10. Stick around.</h3>
<p>The longer you work at it, the more you exist. At the end of this book, I felt the author’s anxiety about dying one day, and realizing that I don’t exist. That the world moved forward and my life didn’t matter. So create, connect and keeping creating and connecting until you’ve made so many mistakes that you can be glad the person you are now is someone you’re proud of.</p>
