<div id="ssh-keys" class="section level2">
<h2>SSH keys</h2>
<p>I find logging in with my password <em>after</em> logging into a password protected computer each time a pain. To get around this, I set up an SSH key to identify my computer uniquely. This requires some basic bash scripting. Can be done with windows with puTTy.</p>
<p><em>Note</em> I will be using the term <strong>local</strong> to represent the computer you are using, and <strong>remote</strong> to represent the computer you are connecting to.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open terminal. use <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code> and follow the prompts. A passphrase can be used, but it creates the same redundant scenario where I need to log in so I leave this as blank. choose wherever you want to store the file. For the sake of this I’m assuming that its in the same folder you’re working from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we have both a public and private key that has been generated (by default this is id_rsa, but it can be whatever you want to call it). We need to pass the public key (<strong>id_rsa.pub</strong>) to wherever we want to SSH to. Keep the private key SAFE and do not share it.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To do this quickly, you can use <code>ssh-copy-id user@serverlogin.ca</code> however this assumes that there is a hidden folder (any file/folder with a . at the start of the file name is considered hidden) named <code>"~/.ssh/authorized_keys"</code>. if you used the quick method, you will be given a warning asking if you’re sure (say yes) and enter your password. if this fails, you will have to login to your remote and create the <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> folders.</p></li>
<li><p>Back on your local machine, you are ready to ssh without using a password ever again. all you need to do is run the following code:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><code>ssh -i id_rsa user@serverlogin.ca</code> where <em>id_rsa</em> is the private key. to go a step further, you can create a bash script with this code alone by running something even simpler like <code>bash login.sh</code> and call it a day.</p>
